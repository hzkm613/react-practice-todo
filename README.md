üìå **Overview:**
This is a simple To-Do application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to create and manage tasks. Users can categorize tasks, track their status (To Do, Doing, Done), and delete them. Users can also toggle between dark mode and light mode. The app makes use of Recoil for state management and Styled Components for styling, providing a clean and maintainable user interface.

üéÆ **Tech Stack & Tools:**
- React
- TypeScript
- Recoil
- Styled Components

üèÜ **Key Achievements:**
- **State Management with Recoil:** A major accomplishment was learning state management with Recoil, which simplifies sharing state between components without prop drilling or context. This is important for building scalable, predictable, and maintainable apps as they grow in complexity.

- **Component Separation:**: Another key achievement was learning how to break down the app into small, reusable components. This made the app much more maintainable, as each component had a single responsibility, which also facilitated easier testing and debugging.

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Implementing a theme switcher (dark/light mode) allowed me to experiment with CSS variables and dynamic theming, providing an improved user experience.

‚ö° **Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Setting Up Theme Colors in theme.ts:** Ensuring the correct application of CSS variables and handling UI responses to theme changes took a bit of trial and error. Eventually, I centralized the theme colors and used Recoil to manage the theme state.

- **State Management with Recoil:**
Initially, understanding how to structure the atoms, selectors, and updates to the global state took some time. Recoil's concepts were new to me, but after experimenting, I understood their use in building a more scalable state management system.

üéØ **Takeaways:**
- **Importance of State Management:**
Managing state is essential for building scalable applications. Recoil made it easier to manage the state of the To-Do items, and learning how to use Recoil's atoms and selectors will help with future projects.

- **Componentization is Key:**
Breaking down the UI into small, reusable components helped maintain a clean architecture and enabled easy updates or replacements in the future. Working with CSS variables and Recoil taught me how to implement global styles that can adapt to user preferences, which is an important feature for modern web apps.
